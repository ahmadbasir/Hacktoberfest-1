### Event details
* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### Rules
To get a shirt, you must make **four pull requests** between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.


## Maintainers

#### How can my project get involved?
Apply the label ”Hacktoberfest” to issues in your GitHub project that are ready for new contributors to work on.

> Here are tips for creating a good Hacktoberfest issue in your project:

* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines to your repo.
* Choose issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained.
* Consider adopting a code of conduct to foster a greater sense of community.

A first time contribution is often more about learning the process than the code itself. Remember we were all new once!

> If you receive **“spammy”** pull requests, please let us know by applying the **“invalid”** label.


## Contributors
**How can I get started?**

Find an issue labeled Hacktoberfest, but remember you aren’t limited to those. Often the best project to contribute to is something you use or depend on every day.

> Here are things to keep in mind when contributing:

* A contribution can be anything—fixing bugs, creating new features, or updating and writing documentation.
* Look for a repo’s CONTRIBUTING.md file for contribution guidelines and instructions.
